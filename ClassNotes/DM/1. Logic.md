a->b = ~a v b
de morgan: if not-ing a condition, then not all elements and invert the operator
~(a v b ) = (~a)n(~b)

assignment
~(a->b) = ~(~a v b)
Morgans low applied
~(~a v b) = ~(~a) n ~(b)
a n ~b

Biconditional:
a <-> b = a -> b n b -> a

a <-> b = "a=b"
goes both ways.

a -> b = "a =< b"
one implies the other, but 

x1 = (a n b) n c                          c
x2 = ~(a v b)
x3 = ~a n b                                  ~(b->a)
x4 = ~a
x5 = a n ~b                                      ~(a->b)
x6 = (a n ~b) v (~a n ~b)                ~b
x7 = (a v b) n ~(a n b)                     ~(a <-> b)
x8 = ~a v ~b     ~(a n b)

X1 = a n b
X2 = (~a n ~b) v (a n b)           a <-> b
X3 = (a n b) v (~a n b)          b
X4 = a -> b
X5 = a
X6 = ~(~a n b)                 b -> a
X7 = ~a n ~b                    a v b
X8 = (a n b) n t              t

∴ "therefore" logic that states if a implied b then b ∴ a
