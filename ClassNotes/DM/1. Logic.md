Class notes from discrete math with logic.
---------------------------------
#### usefull stuff
- [Usefull wiki link for logic symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logic_symbols).
- [Logic software. Good for truth-tables and logic schematics(redigeret)](http://sontrak.com/downloads.html)
- [Logicly 30 days free trial, Good logic software](https://logic.ly/)
Symbols:
-  ~ = not / negation
- n = and operator (&&)
- v = or operator (||)
- -> = implies operator
- <-> = biconditional operator
- ∴ "therefore" logic that states if a implied b then b ∴ a

#### Notes
Prove statement: a->b = ~a v b is true.

De Morgan: if not-ing a condition, then not(inverse) all elements and invert the operator [Usefull link to all Propositional calculus laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus)...

~(a v b ) = (~a)n(~b) is true because...

~(a->b) = ~(~a v b)...

De Morgan law applied...

~(~a v b) = ~(~a) n ~(b)...

Therefor becomes...

a n ~b.

Biconditional:...

a <-> b = a -> b n b -> a...

a <-> b = "a=b"...

ea. goes both ways.

a -> b = "a =< b"...

#### From Truth table exercise
- x1 = (a n b) n c                          c
- x2 = ~(a v b)
- x3 = ~a n b                                  ~(b->a)
- x4 = ~a
- x5 = a n ~b                                      ~(a->b)
- x6 = (a n ~b) v (~a n ~b)                ~b
- x7 = (a v b) n ~(a n b)                     ~(a <-> b)
- x8 = ~a v ~b     ~(a n b)

- X1 = a n b
- X2 = (~a n ~b) v (a n b)           a <-> b
- X3 = (a n b) v (~a n b)          b
- X4 = a -> b
- X5 = a
- X6 = ~(~a n b)                 b -> a
- X7 = ~a n ~b                    a v b
- X8 = (a n b) n t              t
